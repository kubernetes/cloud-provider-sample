#If you are using containerd, make sure docker isn't installed. 
#kubeadm init will try to auto detect the container runtime and at the moment 
#it if both are installed it will pick docker first.
ssh aen@c1-cp1


#0 - Creating a Cluster
#Create our kubernetes cluster, specify a pod network range matching that in calico.yaml! 
#Only on the Control Plane Node, download the yaml files for the pod network.
wget https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml


#Look inside calico.yaml and find the setting for Pod Network IP address range CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR, 
#adjust if needed for your infrastructure to ensure that the Pod network IP
#range doesn't overlap with other networks in our infrastructure.
vi calico.yaml

##IMPORTANT UPDATE - 27 Dec 2022##
#kubeadm 1.22 removed the need to use the parameters --config=ClusterConfiguration.yaml and --cri-socket /run/containerd/containerd.sock
#You can now just use kubeadm init to bootstrap the cluster

sudo kubeadm init

#Before moving on review the output of the cluster creation process including the kubeadm init phases, 
#the admin.conf setup and the node join command


#Configure our account on the Control Plane Node to have admin access to the API server from a non-privileged account.
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config


#1 - Creating a Pod Network
#Deploy yaml file for your pod network.
kubectl apply -f calico.yaml


#Look for the all the system pods and calico pods to change to Running. 
#The DNS pod won't start (pending) until the Pod network is deployed and Running.
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces


#Gives you output over time, rather than repainting the screen on each iteration.
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --watch


#All system pods should be Running
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces


#Get a list of our current nodes, just the Control Plane Node/Master Node...should be Ready.
kubectl get nodes 




#2 - systemd Units...again!
#Check out the systemd unit...it's no longer crashlooping because it has static pods to start
#Remember the kubelet starts the static pods, and thus the control plane pods
sudo systemctl status kubelet.service 


#3 - Static Pod manifests
#Let's check out the static pod manifests on the Control Plane Node
ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests


#And look more closely at API server and etcd's manifest.
sudo more /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
sudo more /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml


#Check out the directory where the kubeconfig files live for each of the control plane pods.
ls /etc/kubernetes
