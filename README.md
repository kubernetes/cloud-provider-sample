# cloud-provider-sample

This is a sample of how to build a cloud provider repo. This will build a Kubernetes image which deploys on bare metal.
It uses the fake cloud provider and consumes the [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
build artifact and adds to it the Cloud Controller Manager and CSI Daemon Set.

**Note:** This is currently a work in progress.
